# Agentic Progress: AI-Driven vs. Hardcoded Functionality

This document summarizes which parts of the Raseed AI-Powered Receipt Intelligence System are truly AI-driven/agentic (where the agent or AI model is making decisions or analysis), and which parts are hardcoded, rule-based, or static.

---

## AI-Driven / Agentic Features

These features use AI models (Gemini via Vertex AI, through LiteLLM) to make decisions, extract information, or generate insights:

- **Receipt Image Analysis**
  - When a user uploads a receipt image, the backend uses the Gemini model to analyze the image, extract merchant, items, total, and other fields.
  - The extraction, classification, and error handling are all AI-driven (not hardcoded rules).

- **Email Receipt Analysis**
  - When simulating or processing real email receipts, the content is sent to Gemini for AI-based extraction of merchant, items, amounts, and insights.
  - The AI model interprets the unstructured text and returns structured data.

- **Insights Generation (Partially AI-Driven)**
  - Insights about spending patterns are generated based on receipt data.
  - The core calculations (totals, categories) are rule-based, but the initial extraction of data is AI-driven.

## Hardcoded / Rule-Based / Static Features

These features are not AI-driven, but rely on static logic or hardcoded text:

- **Dashboard Calculations**
  - Summing totals, grouping by category, and recent activity are implemented with standard Python code, not AI.

- **Wallet Pass Creation**
  - The creation of wallet passes from receipts is rule-based (e.g., formatting title/description), not AI-generated.

- **Simulated Email Templates**
  - The demo emails for simulation are hardcoded text templates, not generated by AI.

- **Suggestions and Messages**
  - Some suggestions and user messages (e.g., "Track daily expenses to identify spending patterns") are static text.

- **Gmail Integration Status**
  - The status and toggling of Gmail integration is pure logic, not AI.

- **Error Handling and Logging**
  - All error messages and logs are static or rule-based.

## Notes
- All AI-driven features rely on external models (Gemini/Vertex AI) and may be affected by their availability or API limits.
- Rule-based features are deterministic and do not adapt to new data without code changes.
- The project is designed to be extensible: more agentic/AI-driven features can be added if needed.
